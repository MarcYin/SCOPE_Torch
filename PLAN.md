### Still incomplete or narrow

1. The default CI path covers the Python test suite and committed benchmark summaries, but it does not run MATLAB parity gates automatically.
2. Device coverage is only partially institutionalized: standalone and coupled runner workflows now have batched-vs-single and dtype coverage, with optional CUDA mirrors on selected workflows, but there is still no broader dtype/device matrix across the lower-level kernels.
3. Workflow parity is still narrow around downstream option coverage and any export targets beyond the current shared NetCDF writer.

### Main accuracy and scope gaps

1. **The benchmark suite is widened, and the non-converged upstream case is now classified explicitly.**
   The MATLAB harness now scales to the full 100-case upstream Latin-hypercube set via `scripts/run_scope_benchmark_suite.py`, with per-case reports in `tests/data/benchmark_suite_reports/` and an aggregate summary in `tests/data/scope_benchmark_suite_summary.json`. The earlier `reflectance.refl` outlier was a benchmark-harness reconstruction bug and is now closed across the full 100-case sweep. The suite now treats upstream scenes that hit `ebal` max iterations as stress diagnostics instead of parity-gating cases. At the moment only case `042` falls into that bucket.
2. **Time-series parity is now covered separately from the scene suite.**
   `scripts/export_scope_timeseries_benchmarks.m` and `scripts/run_scope_timeseries_benchmark_suite.py` now exercise upstream SCOPE `simulation == 1` on the default 30-step verification series, writing per-step reports under `tests/data/timeseries_benchmark_reports/` and an aggregate summary in `tests/data/scope_timeseries_benchmark_summary.json`. The same non-converged-upstream policy applies there: step `026` is currently classified as a stress case because upstream MATLAB `ebal` hits `maxit`.
3. **The raw energy-balance iterate diagnostics are still easy to misread.**
   End-of-iteration same-state parity is now negligible, but the phase-lagged `energy_balance.sunlit_A` and `energy_balance.shaded_A` fields in the raw comparison reports still look worse than the true leaf-kernel parity because they compare the final leaf solve against post-update boundary states. The real parity contract is the committed suite summaries plus the exported `leaf_iteration.*` and same-state energy metrics. That distinction is now reflected in the suite policy, but it still needs broader user-facing documentation.
4. **GPU and batched consistency are only partially institutionalized.**
   The earlier CPU/detach hot spots are gone from the implemented kernels, there is now coupled energy/thermal batched-vs-single coverage, standalone and coupled runner batch-size/dtype coverage, and selected workflows have optional CPU-vs-GPU checks. Broader device and dtype coverage is still missing at the lower-level kernel layer.
5. **Workflow exports are still narrower than the model core.**
   Input preparation, chunk-local batching, metadata-preserving `xarray` assembly, and NetCDF export are now implemented, but downstream format parity beyond NetCDF is not finished.
6. **`mSCOPE` remains a future feature rather than an active implementation target.**
   The current stack now exposes directional and vertical-profile outputs on the homogeneous canopy path, which covers the immediate workflow need. True `mSCOPE` still requires layer-resolved leaf optics and canopy transport plumbing and is intentionally deferred until there is a real consumer for it.

## 2. Revised Target Architecture

### Core packages

1. `scope_torch.spectral`
   Real upstream optical assets, leaf optics, wavelength grids, and soil optics.
2. `scope_torch.canopy`
   Reflectance, fluorescence, and thermal canopy transport on a shared geometry backbone.
3. `scope_torch.biochem`
   Leaf physiology and fluorescence-yield drivers.
4. `scope_torch.energy`
   Aerodynamic resistances, heat fluxes, soil heat treatment, and coupled energy balance closure.
5. `scope_torch.runners`
   Scene and ROI/time entry points over the tensor model core.
6. `scope_torch.io`
   Output assembly back to `xarray` plus file exports.

### Data model principles

1. Keep spectral, layer, and orientation axes explicit in tensors.
2. Keep geometry, meteorology, canopy structure, soil, and solver options explicit in typed dataclasses.
3. Preserve `xarray` coordinates and metadata through the grid workflow instead of requiring manual reshaping after the run.

## 3. Updated Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Kernel hardening and real asset loading

Status: substantially complete.

Completed:
1. Removed the earlier CPU/detach hotspots from the implemented leaf and canopy kernels.
2. Added real upstream optical asset loading for FLUSPECT and soil spectra.
3. Added soil-library and BSM soil support.

Remaining finish items:
1. Extend the current consistency checks to more lower-level kernels across more dtype/device combinations.
2. Add a small set of mixed-dtype smoke tests if GPU support is expected in day-to-day use.

### Phase 1: SCOPE-facing reflectance core

Status: benchmark-locked for the current optical path.

Completed:
1. Wrapped the current leaf optics and canopy reflectance stack behind a SCOPE-facing API.
2. Exposed the full reflectance output set rather than only `rsot` and `rdd`.
3. Added real soil loading and BSM soil generation paths.
4. Locked reflectance outputs against the current MATLAB benchmark suite to negligible relative error.
5. Added explicit directional and radiative-profile APIs on the current homogeneous reflectance stack.

Remaining finish items:
1. Keep the non-converged-scene classification explicit in the benchmark exports and summary reports.

### Phase 2: Canopy fluorescence and thermal radiative transfer

Status: implemented and benchmark-locked for the current product set.

Completed:
1. Added one-pass and layered fluorescence transport.
2. Added biochemical fluorescence coupling.
3. Added spectral thermal radiance and integrated thermal balance outputs.
4. Added coupled energy-balance fluorescence and thermal entry points.
5. Locked fluorescence and thermal transport outputs against the current MATLAB benchmark suite.
6. Added explicit directional and vertical-profile APIs for the current homogeneous fluorescence and thermal workflows.

Remaining finish items:
1. Add any extra exported RT diagnostics needed to isolate future widened-suite outliers faster.
2. Keep the profile-output contracts aligned with the runner surface as widened benchmark coverage grows.

### Phase 3: Biochemistry and energy balance

Status: implemented and benchmark-locked for same-state parity.

Completed:
1. Added leaf biochemistry with Ball-Berry closure and fluorescence-yield outputs.
2. Added aerodynamic resistances and heat-flux kernels.
3. Added a tensor-native energy-balance closure loop.
4. Wired closure outputs into coupled fluorescence and thermal workflows.
5. Added MATLAB benchmark export of the actual final biochemical-call inputs and the exact `L` used by `resistances.m`, which closes the earlier comparison artifacts.
6. Locked current same-state energy-balance parity across the committed scene and time-series benchmark policies, with explicit tolerances versioned in the test suite.

Remaining finish items:
1. Document the distinction between same-state parity and phase-lagged iterate diagnostics in the benchmark reports.
2. Broaden the explicit parity policy if more stress-scene diagnostics need to become gating metrics.

### Phase 4: Production grid and IO workflow

Status: substantially complete.

Completed:
1. Refactored `prepare_scope_input.py` into reusable library functions with configurable inputs and a thin CLI wrapper.
2. Made `ScopeGridDataModule` chunk-local so it no longer materializes one tensor map before batching.
3. Extended `ScopeGridRunner` to preserve metadata and assemble results back into `xarray.Dataset`s for the main workflows.

Remaining finish items:
1. Expose any remaining workflow options needed for parity with current downstream pipelines.
2. Add any remaining tabular or downstream-specific exports needed beyond the shared NetCDF writer only if those are still required by real consumers.

Exit criteria:
1. A prepared ROI/time dataset can be simulated end-to-end and written back with coordinates and metadata intact.
2. Large ROI/time jobs can run in chunks without rewriting the model core.

### Phase 5: Lock parity and regression coverage

Status: substantially complete.

Completed:
1. Kept the widened 100-case MATLAB suite and the single-scene/time-series parity gates in sync with the benchmark exports.
2. Turned the committed suite summaries into versioned tolerances in pytest.
3. Added coupled batched-vs-single regression checks and an optional CPU-vs-GPU check for the energy/thermal path.
4. Added batched-vs-single and dtype regression coverage for the standalone reflectance, fluorescence, biochemical fluorescence, thermal, coupled energy-balance fluorescence, and coupled energy-balance thermal runner paths, plus optional CUDA mirrors on selected workflows.
5. Wired the standard Python test suite into GitHub Actions CI.
6. Added opt-in self-hosted GPU and MATLAB parity jobs to the GitHub Actions workflow.

Remaining finish items:
1. Extend the execution matrix to more lower-level kernels.
2. Decide whether the current opt-in self-hosted MATLAB lane should eventually become a required branch-protection signal.
3. Add mixed-dtype or broader backend coverage if those execution modes are expected in production use.

Exit criteria:
1. Each implemented physics module has reference-backed regression tests in automated CI.
2. The widened MATLAB suite has explicit pass/fail policy for converged and non-converged upstream scenes.
3. End-to-end cases fail fast when parity drifts on CPU or GPU for the supported execution modes.

## 4. Suggested Next Step

The next step should be **finish lower-level kernel execution coverage and close the remaining option-level workflow gaps**.

Recommended sequence:

1. Add any missing lower-level dtype/device smoke tests that would catch kernel-specific regressions before they show up in the runners.
2. Wire any remaining option-level switches, especially `calc_directional` / `calc_vert_profiles` style execution intent in prepared datasets, into whichever runner entry points will own those workflow decisions.
3. Promote the same-state versus phase-lagged energy-diagnostic distinction into the docs and benchmark summaries so future parity regressions are easier to interpret.
4. Decide whether the new self-hosted MATLAB parity lane should remain manual or become a required protected-branch signal.
5. Keep `mSCOPE` as a deferred phase until there is a concrete workflow that requires vertically heterogeneous leaf optics.

Why this should be next:

1. The core model, ROI/time workflow, benchmark policy, NetCDF export surface, and runner execution-mode coverage are already in place, so the highest remaining risk is drift in lower-level kernel behavior rather than missing workflow features.
2. The widened scene and time-series suites already constrain the physics stack tightly enough that the remaining execution-mode work can proceed safely.
3. CI and committed summary tolerances now exist, which makes it practical to harden the remaining workflow surface without losing parity visibility.
