# Variable Glossary

This page is generated from the in-repo variable registry in `scope.variables`.

Use it in two ways:

- browser search through the MkDocs site search bar
- terminal lookup with `scope vars <name>`
- workflow filtering with `scope vars --workflow fluorescence`

The physical meanings are aligned to the current Python implementation and, where relevant, to the original SCOPE documentation at <https://scope-model.readthedocs.io/en/master/outfiles.html>.
