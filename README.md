# SCOPE Torch

PyTorch-first port of the [SCOPE](https://github.com/Christiaanvandertol/SCOPE) canopy radiative transfer model with support for batched simulations, differentiable components, and GPU acceleration.

## Goals
- Maintain parity with the original MATLAB/Fortran implementations for all radiative, fluorescence, and energy balance components.
- Run many simulations (space *or* time grids) simultaneously so weather reanalyses, EO retrievals, and tower data can be fused efficiently.
- Enable gradient-based workflows (calibration, inversion, UQ) by keeping every module differentiable end-to-end.

## Development Roadmap
See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the physics summary, staged translation plan, and GPU-oriented design notes. Short version:
1. **Core physics stack** → leaf optics, 4SAIL reflectance, layered fluorescence, thermal RT, leaf biochemistry, and energy balance are now implemented, and the homogeneous canopy path now exposes explicit directional/profile APIs for reflectance, fluorescence, and thermal RT.
2. **Current parity status** → the benchmark harness now scales to the full 100-case upstream Latin-hypercube suite, and there is now a separate 30-step upstream time-series parity sweep. Converged scene and time-series steps are locked for reflectance, fluorescence, thermal RT, and the coupled energy products, while non-converged upstream `ebal` cases such as scene `042` and time-series step `026` are tracked separately as stress diagnostics.
3. **Workflow status** → the grid path is now chunk-local, metadata-preserving, backed by reusable input-preparation helpers, able to write prepared or simulated `xarray` products through the shared NetCDF export layer, and now exposes directional and vertical-profile reflectance, fluorescence, and thermal workflows through the ROI/time runner surface.
4. **Regression infrastructure** → GitHub Actions now runs the standard Python suite, committed benchmark summaries are versioned in pytest, standalone and coupled runner workflows now have batched-vs-single and dtype coverage, and the remaining hardening gap is broader lower-level kernel/device coverage plus the open MATLAB parity CI policy.
5. **Deferred feature** → true `mSCOPE` support is still planned but intentionally deferred until a real workflow needs vertically heterogeneous leaf optics.

## Testing
After installing the project and dev dependencies, run the unit tests with

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest -q
```

Current coverage is strongest for the implemented kernels:

- `tests/spectral/test_fluspect.py` compares the leaf optics implementation to an analytically equivalent NumPy reference.
- `tests/canopy/test_foursail.py` checks the canopy solver against `prosail`'s 4SAIL implementation.
- `tests/canopy/test_fluorescence.py`, `tests/canopy/test_thermal.py`, and `tests/energy/test_balance.py` cover layered fluorescence, thermal RT, and coupled energy balance.
- `tests/test_scope_grid_runner.py` verifies that the ROI/time runner matches manual single-scene execution paths and now also locks batch-size, dtype/device consistency, plus directional/profile dataset assembly for the standalone reflectance, fluorescence, biochemical fluorescence, and thermal workflows.
- `tests/test_scope_grid_runner.py` also covers batch-size and dtype consistency for the coupled `run_energy_balance_fluorescence(...)` and `run_energy_balance_thermal(...)` workflows, with optional CUDA mirrors where available.
- `tests/test_benchmark_summary_regression.py` locks the committed 100-case scene summary and 30-step time-series summary to explicit tolerances without requiring MATLAB.

Benchmark-policy note:
- Use the committed suite summaries and `leaf_iteration.*` metrics for true same-state parity. Raw `energy_balance.sunlit_*` and `energy_balance.shaded_*` fields in benchmark reports are phase-lagged iterate diagnostics and are not the primary parity contract.

MATLAB parity tooling is also available:

- `tests/test_scope_benchmark_parity.py` is the opt-in single-scene MATLAB parity gate.
- `tests/test_scope_timeseries_benchmark_parity.py` is the opt-in MATLAB time-series parity gate.
- `scripts/compare_scope_benchmark.py` compares one exported MATLAB fixture against the Python implementation.
- `scripts/run_scope_benchmark_suite.py` now sweeps the full upstream Latin-hypercube case set by default and writes `tests/data/scope_benchmark_suite_summary.json`.
- `scripts/run_scope_timeseries_benchmark_suite.py` sweeps the upstream 30-step verification time series and writes `tests/data/scope_timeseries_benchmark_summary.json`.

Continuous integration runs the default Python suite on a hosted CPU matrix via [.github/workflows/tests.yml](.github/workflows/tests.yml). The same workflow also exposes opt-in self-hosted GPU and MATLAB parity jobs on manual dispatch.

Self-hosted workflow notes:
- The GPU job expects a runner labeled `self-hosted`, `linux`, `x64`, `gpu`.
- The MATLAB parity job expects a runner labeled `self-hosted`, `matlab`.
- Set the repository variable `MATLAB_BIN` if the MATLAB executable is not available as `matlab` on the runner `PATH`.
